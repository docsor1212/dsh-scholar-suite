> Historical release notes. Newest first. SKILL.md § Version history keeps only the last three releases; everything older lives here (single source, no duplication).

## What's new in v6.2.0

- **Side-by-side rewrite comparison (`pp_rewrite_check.py --html out.html`)**: the rewrite-effect check was text-only; it now renders one self-contained HTML with the original and revised drafts side by side per aligned paragraph (difflib pairing, similarity shown), per-paragraph score migration colored ↓improved/↑rebounded, header cards for the document-level move and risk-band migration, and the per-feature-type delta table. Aligned rows now carry ≤100-char excerpts (additive JSON fields `original_excerpt`/`revised_excerpt`). All text HTML-escaped; zero external resources; zero network.
- **Signal details in the dashboard (`pp_report_html.py`)**: workflow-based dashboards now include a signal section — register hint, mixed-writing warning, discourse-structure hits and LLM-jargon hit counts (advisory-only, as everywhere) — rendered only when the report actually carries them.

## What's new in v6.1.0

- **Report explainer (`pp_explain.py`, `pp.py explain`)**: any workflow/detect JSON becomes a three-part plain-language reading — verdict (score, risk band, engine mode with degraded-mode medical caveat), evidence (paragraph hi/med/lo with top excerpts, gate verdict, style/term findings aggregated, sentence-suggestion stats), and an action checklist of concrete next commands (paragraph review for mixed-writing, `fix`, `norm`, `term`, trend, bundle). Also reachable through the natural-language router ("解读这份报告").
- **Error glossary extended (`pp_errors.py`)**: the remaining technical phrases the review called out now translate too — AST self-verification hits, baseline drift, author-signature rejection, per-layer gate parse fallback; `pp_verify` prints the next-step line on findings, and the `pp.py` passthrough prints the exit-code meaning whenever a subcommand exits abnormally.
- **Timeout hardening**: `pp.py quickstart` sub-steps now carry a 180s timeout each (a hung step can no longer wedge the demo); the gate layers' existing 120s-timeout + single-retry behavior is now stated in the docs as part of the stability contract.
- **Deep-dive sections moved to `references/`**: the architecture diagram and fingerprint-freshness pipeline notes (calibration split, model-generation coverage) moved from SKILL.md to `references/architecture.md` (linked, read-on-demand) — the main file stays a getting-started document.
- **`references/best-practices.md` (new)**: scenario-level guidance — which profile for which discipline, the correct (human-review) way to use paragraph attribution, the rewrite loop with `rewrite-check`/`trend`, batch organization with the circuit breaker, mode/trust boundaries and compliance; `examples/outputs/` samples are now annotated with the scenario each one answers.

## What's new in v6.0.0

- **Multi-run trend dashboard (`pp_trend.py`, `pp.py trend`)**: single reports answer "what's the score now"; authors iterating on a manuscript need "is the score actually coming down across rounds". Feed it the workflow JSONs from each round (files or a directory), get one self-contained HTML: score trajectory as inline SVG (risk-band colored points, degraded-mode runs hollow), a per-run delta table (↓ improved / ↑ rebound flagged), first→last net-change cards. Honest boundary in the output: a lower score is not a better manuscript — quality is the goal; degraded-mode and full-mode runs are not directly comparable and are marked.
- **Unified error presentation (`pp_errors.py`)**: error handling no longer lives scattered per-script with technical raw messages (zip-bomb guard text etc.). Known guardrail exceptions now render as a two-line, plain-language explanation plus a concrete next step (what to do with an oversized/corrupt .docx, a mislabeled file, a missing model → points to the acquisition guide). Exit-code contract untouched (0/1/2/3). Wired into ai_detector / pp_workflow / pp_report_bundle / docx_text entry points.
- **Grouped entry + English surface (`pp.py`)**: the flat 21-command list is now grouped by scenario (detection / rewrite guidance / conventions & terms / reports & visuals / compliance & assurance / environment) with a three-step beginner path on top; `PP_LANG=en` switches the whole entry surface (help, unknown-command messages, recommend output) to English — the second environment variable alongside `PP_NO_SUP`, both documented in the safety statement.
- **Batch chaos suite**: the bundled tests now include a mixed-chaos batch fixture (corrupt/empty/short/encoding-odd/valid files together) asserting per-file isolation, circuit disclosure and CSV integrity — the long-batch robustness the previous release asked for, now locked by tests.

## What's new in v5.9.0

- **Supervised-model acquisition guide (`pp_setup.py --guide`)**: the biggest remaining zero-config gap was that the optional supervised layer told you how to install a model file but not how to obtain one. The new guide command spells out what the layer is, the author-signed acquisition channel (GitHub issue), placement/verification steps, and the documented degraded-mode semantics when you skip it; `pp_doctor` and `pp_setup --check` now point to the guide whenever the engine runs without the model.
- **Batch circuit breaker (`ai_detector.py --batch ... --circuit N`)**: N consecutive unreadable/failing files now abort the remaining queue (default 5, `--circuit 0` to disable) instead of grinding through a whole folder of garbage — completed files still produce their CSV/report, and the abort is disclosed in both the JSON (`circuit` field) and the text summary. Includes a real stability fix found by the new tests: one corrupt .docx previously killed the entire batch via an uncaught SystemExit; per-file failures now degrade to ERROR rows as designed.
- **Out-of-dictionary neologism probe (`term_check.py --neologism`)**: opt-in heuristic that surfaces high-frequency character strings absent from the term bank as human-review leads (born from the cross-line manuscript standardization review; the bank was blind to self-coined words). Honest boundary stated in the output: uncalibrated, advisory-only, never scored, never feeds the gate; default runs are unchanged.
- **Version-header hygiene**: four scripts still carried engine-file-era version headers (v1.x fossils) inconsistent with the package version — headers are now version-neutral, a release gate (smoke check + unit test) prevents the class from recurring.
- **Progressive disclosure**: the TL;DR now maps the five FAQ groups explicitly, and the architecture section is marked read-on-demand.

## What's new in v5.8.1

- **Terminology bank extended with practice-derived standardization mappings (+27 entries/aliases)**: cross-line review of a medical manuscript surfaced self-coined abbreviations and colloquial metaphors (e.g., informal shorthand for age-specific re-interpretation, pre-vaccination evaluation, primary monitoring parameter) that the bank could not see. They are now registered as aliases of the standard names, so `term_check.py` / `pp.py term` flags each occurrence and suggests the standard term; bank count claim updated to the real loaded figure (2,335 standard terms).
- **Matching-mechanism fix**: candidate resolution is now single-pass longest-first across standards AND aliases — previously a short standard term could claim a span and silently suppress a longer alias overlapping it (a standard 2-char word shadowing a 4-char alias). Legacy behavior (derivation/organization-suffix exclusions, English word boundaries) preserved and now covered by a canary regression test.

## What's new in v5.8.0

- **Single-document visual dashboard (`pp_report_html.py`, `pp.py html-report`)**: renders workflow / detect / fix-suggest / style-norm JSON outputs into one self-contained HTML file — score gauge (inline SVG), paragraph-score histogram, top-paragraph heat table, rewrite-suggestion table, style-norm findings (with jargon hit sentences), and workflow blocks (mixed-document assessment, 4-layer gate, terminology/translation-smell/style/quality, AIGC label evidence, findings ledger). Inline CSS only, zero external resources, zero network, stdlib-only; every text field is HTML-escaped. Inputs are auto-classified by feature keys and can be mixed freely.
- **Natural-language command router (`pp.py recommend "..."`)**: describe the task in plain Chinese or English ("把这段的AI率降一降", "environment trouble"), get the top-3 matching subcommands with ready-to-run commands — lowers the first-contact navigation cost of a 21-subcommand toolkit.
- **Exit-code contract (documented and locked)**: 0 success / 1 ran-but-not-passed / 2 usage-or-input error / 3 environment-not-ready, mirrored by `pp_api`'s `ValueError`/`RuntimeError` — a stability promise for scripts and integrations, stated in SKILL.md and in `pp.py --help`.
- **Docs**: the three most consequential limitations (medical over-scoring in degraded mode, mixed-document averaging, data-coverage scope) now sit right next to the TL;DR instead of only deep in the boundary matrix; a fourth real workflow JSON sample and a rendered HTML sample ship in `examples/outputs/`; the ZH version history was slimmed to match the EN condensation (single source of history: this file); a stale internal identifier was scrubbed from two historical entries.
## What's new in v5.7.1

- **Sample sanitation**: an internal LAN link embedded in the bundled sample document text (examples/outputs/detect_sample.json) was redacted after the hygiene gate flagged it. No code or engine changes — scoring bit-identical to 5.7.0; this build supersedes the ClawHub v5.7.0 package that carried the unsanitized sample.

## What's new in v5.7.0

- **Release-integrity overhaul (mechanistic fix for a live incident)**: v5.6.0 on ClawHub shipped with stale v5.5.0 files under a 5.6.0 label (version-agnostic completion guard blocked re-packaging; a retry then published the stale package). v5.7.0 fixes the mechanism: version-scoped completion guards, immediate post-packaging version assertion in the chain, builder archives version-agnostic guard files at generation time.
- **Sample outputs shipped (`examples/outputs/`)**: real engine JSON responses — detect / llm-jargon norm / fix suggestions — for integration reference.
- **Sentence-level locating** in the llm-jargon check findings; CHANGELOG quick-start banner; SKILL.md version history slimmed to the last three releases (single source of history).

## What's new in v5.6.0

- **LLM-jargon self-check (`pp_style_norm.py` check 7, `--checks llm_jargon`)**: three-tier detection of high-frequency AI-flavor phrasing in Chinese output — L1 metaphor-abuse blacklist, L2 tone words, L3 sentence patterns; findings carry case-library 原句→改句 contrasts and medical-register whitelist phrasings. Cross-line port credited to the immunology deep-read line's 2026-08-31 rejection post-mortem; ported corpus summarized in `eval/results/meddocs_20261014.json`.
- **Honest negative result**: engine scoring of these signals was tried and reverted same-day (held-out: human FPR@medium +1.5pt, current-gen AUROC −1pt). The detector reports hits (`jargon_hits`) without scoring; retry conditions documented in source.

## What's new in v5.5.0

- **Term-consistency check (`pp_style_norm.py` check 5, `--checks consistency`)**: same-concept variant mixing detection driven by a curated bank (`references/term_variants.json`, 23 groups) — flags mixing within one document (never correctness) with per-group unification advice; wired into `pp_workflow` §9.
- **Findings ledger in workflow reports (§10)**: each check marked answered / partially answered / unresolved (mixed-writing stays partially — calibrated attribution is triage-quality) with a budget note.
- **Docs**: sub-tool scope matrix extended; supervised-model acquisition stated; performance-table legend; deep-doc entry header; What's-new condensed into CHANGELOG.

## What's new in v5.4.1

- **Icon release**: new skill icon in the family flat style (white ground, steel-blue frame, signal-yellow hatch, bold "AI%" badge), shipped as `assets/icon-512.png`. No code changes.

## What's new in v5.4.0

- **Journal precheck 2.0 — discipline context**: the journal profile now detects the text's discipline (medical / engineering & CS / social sciences & humanities / general; keyword-density heuristic, `--discipline` override) and adds a per-discipline reading guide. Honest boundary explicit: the 20-25% reference line stays the cross-discipline convention — per-discipline thresholds have no recognized standard and this tool does not invent them.
- **Fingerprint freshness status (`freshness_refresh.py --status`, also `pp.py freshness`)**: last pipeline run, latest held-out evaluation record, bit-exact drift check against the four published baselines, due indicator (35-day interval); `--json` for pipelines, exit 1 on drift.
- **Binary-input guard**: PDF/image/zip at any text entry point → clear explanation with conversion advice (zero-dependency Chinese PDF extraction cannot be guaranteed — the tool says so and exits cleanly).

## What's new in v5.3.0

- **Word documents as first-class input (`scripts/docx_text.py`)**: every entry point now reads .docx directly — single-file detection, `--batch` (auto-collects `*.docx`), `pp_workflow`, `pp_fix_suggest`, `pp_style_norm`, `pp_rewrite_check`, `deai_gate`, and the bundle command. Zero dependencies (stdlib zipfile + XML), paragraph-preserving extraction, zip-bomb guards (uncompressed-size / member-count caps).
- **Submission self-check bundle (`scripts/pp_report_bundle.py`, also `pp.py bundle`)**: one command produces a dated self-check directory — workflow report (MD+JSON), paragraph-attribution HTML, rewrite suggestions, style-norm findings, README manifest with reading order and the integrity notice.
- **Docs**: Sub-tool scope matrix (each sub-tool's calibrated domain and outside-domain behavior — terminology bank scope, translation-smell coverage honesty, stylometry register limits); FAQ reorganized into grouped numbered sections (verdicts → modes → output → safety → tools).

## What's new in v5.2.0

- **Academic style-norm self-check (`scripts/pp_style_norm.py`, also `pp.py norm`)**: mechanical formatting conventions rather than AI-flavor — full/half-width mixing, number-usage consistency, abbreviation first-use definitions (with a common exempt list), unit formatting including the invisible U+03BC/U+00B5 mu mixing. Findings with concrete advice only; no score, no risk band, independent of AI-rate detection. Wired into `pp_workflow` (§9) and exposed as `pp_api.style_norm()`.
- **`--batch --report` direct output**: `ai_detector --batch DIR --csv scores.csv --report report.html` renders the HTML summary in the same run.
- **Eval archive hygiene**: `eval/results/archive/README.md` explains the `STALE-cache-poisoned` filename markers — deliberately-kept voided results of the 2026-10-02 cache-poisoning incident (evidence, not live data; incident and structural fix in CHANGELOG v4.4.0).

## What's new in v5.1.0

- **Rewrite-effect regression check (`scripts/pp_rewrite_check.py`, also `pp.py rewrite-check`)**: engine-source comparison of the original vs the revised draft — document-level score and risk-band migration, paragraph-level difflib-aligned per-paragraph deltas, feature-type counts cleared vs remaining (same seven types as `pp_fix_suggest`), edit extent (char ratio + replaced-paragraph rate). A relative reference under this engine's criteria only — never an institutional verdict. Ships with `--json`, `--demo`, and `pp_api.rewrite_check()`.
- **Batch HTML summary report (`scripts/pp_batch_report.py`, also `pp.py batch-report`)**: renders `--batch --csv` output into a single self-contained HTML — totals/mean/risk-band cards, a score histogram, and a per-file table sorted by score with ERROR/unknown rows surfaced. Zero dependencies; renders the existing CSV without re-running the engine.
- **Docs**: batch CSV concurrency semantics (atomic temp+rename since v4.9.0) and a `degraded_notice` reading guide are now explicit in the FAQ.

## What's new in v5.0.0

- **Sentence-level rewrite suggestions (`scripts/pp_fix_suggest.py`, also `pp.py fix`)**: the natural next question after a score — which sentences, why, and how to improve them. Each flagged sentence lists its concrete features (AI clichés, filler phrases, template patterns, vague qualifiers, connective openers, dash/colon habits, uniform rhythm) with a per-type rewrite strategy. Guidance only: it locates and suggests, never auto-rewrites. Ships with `--json`, a built-in two-sample demo (`--demo`), and a `fix_suggest` block in `pp_workflow` reports.
- **Bundled unit-test suite (`tests/`, `pp.py test`)**: 44 stdlib-unittest cases covering the iron laws (short text / empty / GBK), report field contracts, JSON purity, the gate, the workflow Markdown layout, data files, and the new tools — verifiable on your own machine without the model.
- **Structured zero-network self-verification (`scripts/pp_verify.py`, also `pp.py verify`)**: an AST-level scan of every script — flags network imports/calls and curl/wget-style subprocess commands, while URL strings in report footers are correctly treated as data (the old grep advice could not tell the two apart). Exit 0 = zero network calls.
- **Register awareness 2.0**: literary-narrative texts get a dedicated register notice (this register sits outside the academic calibration domain; measured literary classics can reach high band here) so the result is not mistaken for AI evidence. Disclosure only — no scoring change; all previously published numbers remain reproducible.
- **Packaging**: `requirements.txt` ships (core zero-dependency; optional supervised-layer extras commented); `pp.py quickstart` (zero-model demo: detect → fix → doctor); `pp_doctor` reports the latest held-out evaluation record; quality_report row added to the script cheat sheet.

## What's new in v4.9.0

- **Mixed-document calibration (closing the v4.7.0 backlog)**: paragraph-level hi/med/lo thresholds calibrated on the controlled mixed benchmark (333 paragraphs with ground truth; best operating point ≥50: precision 0.60 at 63% coverage — honestly below the automatic-verdict bar, ranking aid only). Calibration semantics corrected mid-flight: the earlier grid excluded the middle band from the binary classification, inflating F1 to 0.85; recalculated with full-below-threshold semantics (true F1 0.6131). Ships as `references/para_thresholds.json` and surfaces in every `mixed_document` assessment.
- **Unified entry (`scripts/pp.py`)**: one command routes all eleven subcommands — script-navigation cost zeroed.
- **Reliability**: batch CSV writes are now atomic (temp+rename, concurrent batch runs safe); gate layers retry once on crash/timeout before the neutral fallback.

## What's new in v4.8.0

- **Measurement integrity fixes from an independent third-party test round** (13 findings, verified one by one; the real bugs are fixed here, the capability observations are disclosed honestly):
  - `run_eval.py` cache keys now include the engine mode (`:nosup` suffix) — a rules-only evaluation could previously replay supervised-layer cached scores, making the base-engine numbers unreproducible. Reproducible now, fingerprint-and-mode-bound: rules-only **0.8985** old-gen / **0.7149** current-gen (bundled sample).
  - `--profile journal --format json` now emits **pure JSON** (journal precheck embedded as a `journal_precheck` field with both statistics explained — distribution vs intensity口径 measure different things).
  - `risk_bands` (active medium/high thresholds + calibration tier) is now surfaced in every report — the supervised and rules tiers carry independently calibrated thresholds, which fully explains score-band differences across modes.
  - `mixed_signal` denoised: both extremes must each cover ≥25% of paragraphs (a pure-AI document with one low-scoring outlier no longer flags as mixed).
  - Single files >5 MB now print a warning in single-file mode (batch still skips them); `--batch` directory requirement stated in the error message.
- **Honest disclosures**: real-world medical papers (PDF→text) can score elevated even in full mode — paragraph attribution is the actionable signal; fingerprint attribution is heuristic (top-n, never scored) and may misattribute. See FAQ.
- **Doc precision**: bundled-corpus scope clarified (n=1,304 sample vs n=5,251 full); terminology count corrected to 2,308 loaded; zero-network verification command made import-precise.

---

## What's new in v4.7.0

- **Mixed-document special**: a controlled mixed-writing benchmark with per-paragraph ground truth (54 synthesized docs built from held-out test-half sources only; `eval/build_mixed_bench.py`, results in `eval/results/mixed_para_20261005.json`) quantifies what the boundary matrix could only hint at: document-level AUROC 0.52-0.54 is an inherent averaging limitation, while **paragraph-level AUROC reaches 0.69** — paragraph attribution is triage-quality for locating suspect paragraphs (not an auto-verdict). `pp_workflow.py` now emits a `mixed_document` assessment (detection, AI-fraction estimate, guidance) and flags mixed documents prominently in the Markdown report.
- **Discoverability**: description gained a "Trigger on" routing-word block; README gained the China mirror (ModelScope) link. No behavior change.

## What's new in v4.6.0

- **End-to-end workflow (`scripts/pp_workflow.py` / `pp_api.workflow()`)**: one command runs the full self-check — AI-rate detection, paragraph-level attribution, 4-layer gate, terminology, translation-smell, style, quality report, AIGC label self-check — and writes a single Markdown report plus the full JSON. Worked example in § Quick start.
- **TL;DR layer & docs restructure**: a 30-second orientation section now sits at the top; historical release notes moved to `CHANGELOG.md`; anti-pattern guidance is consolidated in one section; the English FAQ is now on par with the Chinese one.
- **Cleaner eval archive & actionable errors**: superseded eval artifacts moved to `eval/results/archive/`; pp_api/pp_setup errors now carry recovery hints.

## What's new in v4.5.0

- **Python API (`scripts/pp_api.py`)**: the engine is now importable. `detect_text(text)` runs the full detector in-process (same code path as the CLI — parity-checked) and returns a plain JSON-able dict; helpers cover the rest of the toolkit: `gate_text`, `term_report`, `smell_report`, `style_report`, `quality_report_file`, `attribution`, `model_fingerprint`, `doctor_summary`. Zero network, zero third-party dependencies, exceptions instead of silent failures. Programmatic integration no longer requires wrapping subprocess calls.
- **One-command supervised setup (`scripts/pp_setup.py`)**: `--model <file>` replaces manual multi-step model placement. The file's md5 is checked against the author-signed fingerprint registry (`references/supervised_models.json`) — unknown weights are rejected (exit 2) — then the model is installed, inference-canaried, and confirmed GREEN; `--check` shows current status. The model still never ships inside the package and nothing is ever downloaded (the 100%-local contract is intact).

## What's new in v4.4.0

- **Headline numbers re-measured under verified conditions — they changed**: pre-2026 held-out AUROC **0.9998** (was believed 0.9022) and current-generation AUROC **0.9400** (was believed 0.6542), human FPR@medium **2.3%** (was believed ~20%). The old figures were measurement artifacts: eval score-cache keys did not bind the model (stale scores replayed across releases) and the deployed model binary was never fingerprinted. Both failure modes are structurally impossible since v4.4.0: cache keys carry the model md5 (`model_fp` in every result JSON) and `pp_doctor` prints the model fingerprint for audit.
- **Model rollout halted by the new data-hygiene audit (negative result, data-closed)**: the planned supervised-layer retrain (v36: 7187 prior rows + 285 fresh current-generation samples) was deployed and initially evaluated at near-perfect separation (old-gen 0.9994) — then rejected by our own new contamination audit: those 285 "fresh" samples had been drawn from the current-generation eval set itself (64.6% of gen2026 eval docs entered training, 154 of them from the held-out half). All v36 numbers are void; the shipped supervised model remains **v35** (fingerprint `2631df3d388b`, re-export verified; the contamination audit shows v35's training data shares only 1 held-out doc with the eval corpora, so its numbers are clean). An honest retrain needs a fresh sampling round (currently frozen); `eval/check_leak.py` now gates every future training run.
- **Evaluation score cache binds the deployed model fingerprint**: `run_eval.py` cache keys now include the model md5 — swapping models can no longer silently replay stale scores (a 10-02 v36 eval reading "bit-identical 0.9022" was exactly this failure; the true v36 numbers surfaced only after the fix). Result JSONs carry `model_fp`.
- **ONNX export self-test + ONNX thread budget**: export now runs variable-length inference assertions before a binary ships (a transformers 4.57.6 regression baked the dynamic axes into a static seq=150 graph — it now dies at export, not in production); `PP_ORT_THREADS` caps the ONNX thread pool (default auto) — on 56-vCPU hosts the unrestricted pool thrashed (24.9 s/doc → ~1 s/doc at 8 threads); `pp_doctor` prints the model md5 fingerprint for audit.

## What's new in v4.3.0

- **Generation-split evaluation (infrastructure + first numbers)**: a 443-doc current-generation eval set (312 fresh AI samples from 9 families + 131 held-out human docs) now ships in `eval/corpora_small/eval_gen2026.jsonl`; `run_eval.py --layer` fixed. First quantified generational breakdown: pre-2026 corpus AUROC 0.9022 vs current-gen 0.6542 — the generation gap is now measured, not assumed.
- **Negative results ×2, data-closed**: spectrum v2 blend and the L13 surprisal signal both show no current-gen gains (bit-identical and 0.32 respectively) — the remaining remedy is supervised-layer retraining on fresh samples (planned).

## What's new in v4.2.0

- **Batch recursion**: `--batch DIR --recursive` walks subdirectories; per-file paths are reported relative to the root.
- **GitHub README**: the repository landing page now carries the tool description, quick start, family table, and compliance statement (agents discovering via `skills add` see the full picture).
- **Gate layer-3 distribution check**: post-revival verdict distribution verified on 40 held-out documents — zero parse failures, no systematic band shift (data archived).

## What's new in v4.1.0

- **Smoothness layer fused into the score (A/B-verified)**: the L13 surprisal-variation signal (0.06 weight in all length bands) is now part of the fusion. Held-out A/B: **AUROC bit-identical to baseline (0.9022), human FP unchanged** — the signal has real influence on current-generation text where it fires, at zero measured cost on the evaluation corpus.
- **Batch CSV output**: `--batch DIR --csv PATH` writes per-file results as CSV (Excel-friendly UTF-8 BOM).
- **Paragraph report disclosures**: the HTML attribution report now carries mixed-register warnings, register hints, and encoding warnings — consistent with the JSON report.

## What's new in v4.0.0

- **Cross-references**: reports and docs now include next-step pointers to adjacent tools (citation verification, deep research, figures) with the arXiv hallucinated-citation policy note.
- **Word-root coverage**: description now carries the full task-language root set (academic writing / polish / batch rewriting guidance / terminology) for search discoverability.
- **Family section cleanup**: docsor.cn placed after the member list; list continuity fixed (EN/ZH).

## What's new in v3.12.0

- **Translation-smell layer revived in the gate (substantive fix)**: deai_gate's layer-3 parser expected a `hits[]` array while `translation_smell_check --json` emitted only `total_hits` — the layer had been silently neutral (fallback 50) since the schema drifted. Schema aligned; the layer now genuinely contributes to the fused score.
- **Integrity notice on every report**: term_check / quality_report / style_distance / translation_smell outputs now carry the same academic-integrity notice as ai_detector/deai_gate — the "every report" claim is now literally true.
- **Paragraph-count consistency**: quality_report now counts paragraphs with the same whitespace/short-segment filtering as ai_detector (trailing-newline mismatch fixed).
- Negative results recorded: spectrum v2 blend (fresh-generation 0.15 mix) produced a bit-identical held-out AUROC — not adopted; L13 mid-length (300-800 chars) extension evaluated and declined (human-side evaluable sample too small, FPR 2/10 at threshold).

## What's new in v3.11.0

- **Batch detection (`--batch DIR`)**: score every `.txt`/`.md` file in a directory in one run — per-file scores, aggregate stats (mean/max/high-risk count), deterministic, files >5 MB skipped. Built for thesis-scale self-review.
- **Paragraph report consistency**: the HTML attribution report now carries the same academic-integrity notice as the CLI reports.
- **Negative result, honestly recorded**: cross-family tier-2 n-gram mining over 285 fresh samples yielded nothing beyond topic-word noise after guards (the two real markers were already registered) — pattern-recall expansion via n-grams has hit its ceiling, consistent with the v3.0 recalibration. Fingerprint registrations this cycle: none qualified (quality gate held).

## What's new in v3.10.0

- **Fingerprint freshness phase 3 (current-generation coverage)**: 135 fresh samples across four model families (kimi-k2.7 / minimax-m3 / deepseek-v4.1 / glm-5.3) via the OpenCode Go channel; **kimi-k2.7 registered** (zero-FP pattern, Kimi-family attribution verified), contaminated candidates (topic words, cross-family markers) rolled back per quality gate, glm-5.3 refreshed with no new patterns. Registry: 13 families. Quality over quantity — every registration is attribution-verified.

## What's new in v3.9.0

- **Discourse smoothness disclosure (L13, DivEye-inspired)**: a new surprisal-variation layer measures how uniformly word choice varies across sliding windows — AI generation tends to be smooth, human writing uneven. Held-out long-document stats: AUROC 0.8256 as a standalone signal, detection 66/146 at threshold 6, human false-positive 1/14. **By the reproducible-numbers iron law it is NOT fused into the score** (single-layer SNR insufficient); it appears as an evidence line in reports (`layers_surface.surprisal_variation_layer`, with a spectrum-coverage guard at 0.35 and an evidence discount for low-coverage text).
- **Layer evaluation mode**: `python eval/run_eval.py --layer surprisal --split test` gives any report layer a reproducible AUROC/detection/FPR card (results saved to `eval/results/layer_*.json`) — the framework that let us measure L13 honestly instead of shipping it fused on faith.

## What's new in v3.8.0

- **Mixed-register signal (`mixed_signal`)**: when paragraph scores diverge sharply, reports now say so explicitly ("document may combine human and AI writing; document-level score unreliable") and point to `paragraph_report.py` — turning the documented mixed-document limitation (AUROC 0.38 document-level) into an in-engine guardrail (aligned with the field's move to three-class human/AI/mixed evaluation and bidirectional paraphrase benchmarks).
- **Register hint (`register_hint`)**: colloquial/narrative features in Chinese text trigger an advisory that scores are calibrated on academic prose.
- **Encoding warning (`encoding_warning`)**: many undecodable bytes (GBK/binary) trigger a distortion warning.
- **Gate layer-divergence disclosure**: deai_gate reports when the word layer and style layer disagree sharply (≥30), a pattern seen in deliberate style-imitation rewrites and register mixing.
- **Safety and behavior statement**: self-verifiable local-only / no-upload / no-credential / no-persistence commitments (aligned with platform review trends).
- **Fingerprint freshness second pass**: qwen3.8 balanced sampling (35 docs) yielded no low-FP patterns — honestly not registered (same as deepseek-v4); kimi-k3 registration stands.

## What's new in v3.7.0

- **Discourse-structure heuristic layer (L12)**: detects social-media-style document-level AI patterns — hook ("先看一个场景"/"imagine…") + reversal ("不是X，是Y") + slogan ("把这句话记住"/"划重点") + engagement bait / parallelism / self-Q&A / spoken-word closing / emotional intensifiers — eight pattern groups; ≥2 distinct groups add a density-scaled bump (8×groups + hits capped at 8, total cap 30); single-group hits are recorded without scoring (zero false-positive impact on academic prose). Fixes a sentence-layer blind spot: pure discourse-pattern text previously scored 21-32/low; held-out academic regression bit-identical (AUROC 0.9022, zero false positives).
- **FAQ section (evaluation-driven: C dimension "lacks a centralized FAQ")**: ten high-frequency questions — short-text policy, medical-register over-scoring, supervised-layer install/verification, degraded_mode semantics, non-interchangeability with CNKI/Wanfang, layer-failure fallback, edit_extent scope, English support boundary, label-check usage.
- **Script cheat sheet (C: "per-script usage could be more detailed")**: purpose/flags/output for all eight entry points in one table.
- **Clearer edge-case errors (R)**: style_distance now explains *why* no style score was produced (no sentence boundaries / no body paragraphs) instead of a generic "too short".

## What's new in v3.6.0

- **Academic-integrity guardrails**: every report now carries an explicit `integrity_notice` field/line; new "Academic integrity" section; positioning stated plainly — author self-review and writing quality, compliance with disclosure rules, not detector evasion.
- **Positioning clarified**: documentation wording aligned to the quality-framed scope (detection and revision guidance stay; no detector-evasion framing).

## What's new in v3.5.0

- **Degraded-mode disclosure**: `ai_detector.py` now reports `degraded_mode` + `degraded_notice` (JSON and text) whenever the supervised layer is absent, disabled (`PP_NO_SUP=1`), or skipped by language gating — including the medical-register over-score warning with the actual held-out numbers.
- **Iron law #2 enforced**: texts under 100 characters now return `risk=unknown` with an explicit no-verdict notice (previously documented but not implemented; short texts also show as "cannot judge" in `quality_report.py` instead of a misleading green).
- **`scripts/pp_doctor.py`**: one-command environment self-check — data integrity, script compilation, optional deps, model presence, supervised-layer loadability, short-text/long-text/determinism probes, deai_gate guard. Exit 0 = green.
- **`deai_gate.py` usage guard + closed fallback loop**: `--help` / missing file no longer run the gate on a bogus filename; layer timeouts are caught (neutral 50); a failed smell layer now falls back to a neutral 50 instead of 0, and a failed terminology layer no longer dumps tracebacks into notes.
- **Chinese-Windows encoding hardening**: every entry point forces UTF-8 stdout/stderr and tolerates non-UTF-8 (e.g. GBK) input files — no more crashes on default zh-CN consoles (found by adversarial multi-expert testing).
- Docs rebuilt in honest dual-language form (this file + SKILL_ZH.md); trigger words expanded (AI率 / 查AI率 / AIGC 检测 …).

# 更新日志（中文）

> v4.6.0 起历史更新说明移出 SKILL_ZH.md（新用户更快触达工作流）。最新在前。各版本摘要亦见 SKILL_ZH.md § 版本历史。

## v6.2.0 更新内容

- **改写对照双栏 HTML（`pp_rewrite_check.py --html out.html`）**：改写效果对比此前只有文本输出，现在可渲染一份自包含 HTML——按 difflib 对齐逐段并排展示原稿/改稿摘录（含相似度），逐段分数迁移着色（↓改善/↑回升），顶部卡片呈现文档级变化与风险带迁移，附特征类型增减表。对齐行新增 ≤100 字摘录字段（JSON 加法字段 `original_excerpt`/`revised_excerpt`）。全部文本 HTML 转义；零外部资源；零网络。
- **仪表盘信号细节节（`pp_report_html.py`）**：workflow 仪表盘新增「信号细节」——语域提示、混写预警、篇章结构特征命中、LLM 腔命中数（与全工具一致：只提示不计分），仅在报告实际携带时渲染。

## v6.1.0 更新内容

- **报告解读器（`pp_explain.py`，`pp.py explain`）**：任意 workflow/detect JSON → 三段人话——【结论】分数/风险带/档位（降级档医学警告如实转述）、【证据】段落 hi/med/lo 与最高分段摘录、门禁判定、规范与术语 findings 聚合、句子建议统计、【行动清单】按报告内容给出可执行命令（混写→逐段复核、fix/norm/term、趋势、投稿打包）。自然语言路由「解读这份报告」可达。
- **错误词典扩展（`pp_errors.py`）**：评审点名的剩余技术话术全部人话化——AST 自证命中、基线漂移、作者签发拒绝、门禁层解析回退；`pp_verify` 命中时输出下一步指引；`pp.py` 透传遇到异常退出码时打印契约含义与 doctor 指路。
- **超时加固**：`pp.py quickstart` 三个子步各加 180 秒超时（单步卡死不再拖死演示）；门禁层既有的 120 秒超时+一次重试行为写入文档稳定性契约。
- **深水区外迁 `references/`**：架构图与指纹保鲜流水线说明（校准切分、代际覆盖）从 SKILL.md 迁至 `references/architecture.md`（保留链接、按需阅读）——主文档回归上手文档定位。
- **`references/best-practices.md`（新增）**：场景级指南——什么学科选什么口径、段落归因的正确（人工复核）用法、改写循环（rewrite-check/trend）、批量组织与熔断、档位与可信度边界、合规；`examples/outputs/` 每个样例标注了它回答什么场景。

## v6.0.0 更新内容

- **多轮趋势仪表盘（`pp_trend.py`，`pp.py trend`）**：单次报告只回答「现在多少分」，多轮改稿真正要问的是「改了这么多版分数到底有没有降」。把每轮的 workflow JSON（文件或目录）喂给它，得到一张自包含 HTML：分数轨迹内联 SVG（风险带着色、降级轮空心点）、逐轮 delta 表（↓改善/↑回升醒目标注）、首末净变化卡片。诚实边界写入输出：分数下降不等于内容更好——改稿以质量为准；降级档与融合档轮次不可直接互比且有标注。
- **统一错误呈现（`pp_errors.py`）**：错误处理不再分散各脚本、技术原文直出（如 zip-bomb 护栏文案）。已知护栏异常统一渲染为「人话解释 + 具体下一步」两行（过大/损坏 docx 怎么办、扩展名与实际格式不符怎么办、缺模型 → 指向获取指南）。退出码契约不动（0/1/2/3）。已接入 ai_detector / pp_workflow / pp_report_bundle / docx_text 四入口。
- **分组入口 + 英文面（`pp.py`）**：21 个子命令的平铺清单改为按场景分组（检测/改写建议/规范与术语/报告与可视化/合规与自证/环境），顶部置新手三步；`PP_LANG=en` 把入口面（帮助/未知命令提示/推荐输出）整体切英文——与 `PP_NO_SUP` 并列的第二个环境变量，均已写入安全声明。
- **批处理混沌压测套件**：随包测试新增混合混沌夹具（损坏/空/过短/编码异常/正常文件同目录），断言逐文件隔离、熔断披露与 CSV 完整性——上一版点名的长批健壮性，现在有测试锁定。

## v5.9.0 更新内容

- **监督模型获取指南（`pp_setup.py --guide`）**：零配置体验的最后一块缺口——可选监督层只讲「怎么装」不讲「去哪拿」。新指南命令写清该层是什么、作者签发获取渠道（GitHub issue）、放置与验证步骤、以及不装时的降级档语义；`pp_doctor` 与 `pp_setup --check` 在引擎处于降级档时会主动指到指南。
- **批处理熔断器（`ai_detector.py --batch ... --circuit N`）**：连续 N 个文件解析/检测失败即中止剩余队列（默认 5，`--circuit 0` 关闭），不再对着整目录坏文件白烧时间——已完成部分照常出 CSV/报告，中止事实写入 JSON（`circuit` 字段）与文本摘要。随附一个由新测试抓出的真实稳定性修复：此前一个损坏 .docx 会经未捕获 SystemExit 炸掉整批，现在按设计降级为逐文件 ERROR 行。
- **词典外新造词探测（`term_check.py --neologism`）**：opt-in 启发式，把「高频出现却不在术语库」的字串作为人工复核线索输出（源自跨线文稿规范化复盘——词典对自创词不可见）。诚实边界写入输出：未校准、只提示不判定对错、永不计分、永不汇入门禁；默认运行完全不变。
- **版本头卫生**：四个脚本仍带着引擎文件时代（v1.x 化石）的版本头，与包版本不一致——头已中性化，并新增发布闸（smoke 检查+单元测试）防此类复发。
- **渐进披露**：TL;DR 明示 FAQ 五个分组，架构节标注「按需阅读」。

## v5.8.1 更新内容

- **术语库扩充实战对照映射（+27 条/别名）**：跨线文稿复盘发现一批自创缩略语与口语隐喻（如「龄化复判」「活疫苗门禁」「头号盯防」类表述）此前词典无法识别。现全部以别名挂靠规范名——`term_check.py` / `pp.py term` 逐词命中并给出规范名建议；文档计数声明更新为真实加载量（2,335 个规范名）。
- **匹配机制修复**：候选裁决改为单遍「最长优先」（标准词与别名同池全局裁决）——旧两遍扫描中短标准词可占位静默压制重叠的更长别名（2 字标准词挡住 4 字别名即漏报）。既有行为（派生词/机构名后缀排除、英文词边界）全部保留并由金丝雀回归测试锁定。

## v5.8.0 更新内容

- **单文档可视化仪表盘（pp_report_html.py，`pp.py html-report`）**：把 workflow / detect / fix_suggest / style_norm 的 JSON 产物渲染成一份自包含 HTML——分数半环仪表（内联 SVG）、段落分数直方图、段落热表、改写建议表、规范 findings 表（含 LLM 腔命中句），以及 workflow 附加块（混写评估/四层门禁/术语/翻译腔/文体/质量/AIGC 证据/台账）。内联 CSS、零外部资源、零网络、纯标准库；全部文本字段经 HTML 转义。输入按特征键自动识别，可任意混搭。
- **自然语言命令路由（`pp.py recommend "..."`）**：用一句中文或英文描述需求（如「把这段的AI率降一降」「环境跑不起来」），返回命中度最高的三个子命令与可直接复制的命令行——降低 21 个子命令工具箱的首次定位成本。
- **退出码契约（入档并锁定）**：0 成功 / 1 运行完成但未通过 / 2 用法或输入错误 / 3 环境不满足，与 `pp_api` 的 `ValueError`/`RuntimeError` 同构——对脚本与集成方的稳定性承诺，写入 SKILL.md 与 `pp.py --help`。
- **文档**：三条最重要的限制（降级档医学高估/混写均值稀释/数据覆盖范围）前置到 TL;DR 旁；`examples/outputs/` 新增真实 workflow JSON 样例与渲染 HTML 样例；中文版本历史瘦身对齐英文（唯一完整历史=本文件）；清理历史条目中一处过时内部编号。
## v5.7.1 更新内容

- **样例脱敏**：随包样例文档文本中一处内网链接（examples/outputs/detect_sample.json）经卫生闸检出后脱敏。代码与引擎零变更——打分与 5.7.0 逐位一致；本版取代曾携带未脱敏样例的 ClawHub v5.7.0 包。

## v5.7.0 更新内容

- **发布完整性机制化改造（线上事故的机制级修复）**：v5.6.0 在 ClawHub 携带了 v5.5.0 旧文件（版本无关完成守卫误拦重打包+重试引用陈旧包）；v5.7.0 修机制：版本化完成守卫/链内打包后即时版本断言/构建器生成时归档旧守卫文件。
- **随包输出样例（`examples/outputs/`）**：检测/LLM 腔规范自查/改写建议的真实引擎 JSON 响应。
- **LLM 腔自查命中句定位**；CHANGELOG 快速上手横幅；SKILL.md 版本历史瘦身为最近三版（历史单一来源）。

## v5.6.0 更新内容

- **LLM 腔自查（第 7 查）**：中文输出高频 AI 腔三层检测（L1 隐喻滥用黑名单/L2 语气词/L3 句式模式），findings 附判例库「原句→改句」对照与医学语体白名单；跨线移植注明来源（免疫深读线判废复盘），摸底语料汇总随包 `eval/results/meddocs_20261014.json`。
- **诚实负结果**：引擎计分当日试当日回退（留出集人类 FPR@medium +1.5pt、当打代 AUROC −1pt）；检测器只报命中不计分，重试条件写入源码。

## v5.5.0 更新内容

- **术语一致性检查（`pp_style_norm.py` 第 5 查）**：同概念异写混用检测，词库 23 组（患者/病人、禁忌证/禁忌症、数据/资料、approximately/~…）；检测混用非对错，按组给统一建议；已并入 `pp_workflow` §9。
- **Findings Ledger（§10）**：workflow 报告每项检查标记 answered / partially / unresolved（混写判定恒 partially——校准即 triage 级）+ 预算说明。
- **文档**：子功能适用域矩阵补全；监督模型获取方式明示；性能表版本时代标注；深文档入口头；What's new 收敛入 CHANGELOG。

## v5.4.1 更新内容

- **图标版**：全新技能图标（家族扁平风：白底+钢蓝框+信号黄斜纹+特粗 AI% 徽章），随包 `assets/icon-512.png`。零代码变更。

## v5.4.0 更新内容

- **期刊口径 2.0——分学科语境**：期刊口径预检自动识别学科（`--discipline` 可覆盖）并给出分学科解读指引；20-25% 参考线不变，明示不虚构分学科数字。
- **指纹保鲜状态（`freshness_refresh.py --status`，或 `pp.py freshness`）**：最近执行/最新评测记录/四条已发布基线逐位漂移检查/到期提醒；`--json` 供管道，漂移 exit 1。
- **二进制输入护栏**：PDF/图片/zip 在任意文本入口得到明确解释与转存建议，不再静默乱码。

## v5.3.0 更新内容

- **Word 文档一等公民输入（`scripts/docx_text.py`）**：所有入口直读 .docx——单文件检测、`--batch` 自动收集、`pp_workflow`、`pp_fix_suggest`、`pp_style_norm`、`pp_rewrite_check`、`deai_gate` 与自查包命令。零依赖（标准库 zipfile+XML），按段落保留文本，解压炸弹防护。
- **投稿前自查包（`scripts/pp_report_bundle.py`，或 `pp.py bundle`）**：一条命令产出带时间戳自查目录——workflow 报告（MD+JSON）、段落归因 HTML、改写建议、规范自查 findings、README 清单。
- **文档**：子功能适用域矩阵（每个子工具的校准域与域外行为逐一明示）；FAQ 重组为分组编号章节。

## v5.2.0 更新内容

- **学术写作规范自查（`scripts/pp_style_norm.py`，或 `pp.py norm`）**：机械体例核对而非 AI 痕迹——全半角混用、数字用法一致性、缩写首次定义（含惯用豁免表）、单位格式（含 μ U+03BC/µ U+00B5 隐形混用）。仅输出带具体改法的 findings；不评分、无风险带，与 AI 率检测相互独立。已并入 `pp_workflow`（§9），SDK 暴露 `pp_api.style_norm()`。
- **`--batch --report` 直出**：`ai_detector --batch DIR --csv scores.csv --report report.html` 同一次跑完即渲染 HTML 汇总。
- **评测存档卫生**：`eval/results/archive/README.md` 解释 `STALE-cache-poisoned` 文件名标记——2026-10-02 缓存污染事故的作废结果（证据性保留；事故与结构性修复见 CHANGELOG v4.4.0）。

## v5.1.0 更新内容

- **改写效果回归验证（`scripts/pp_rewrite_check.py`，或 `pp.py rewrite-check`）**：引擎同源对比原稿与改稿——文档级分数与风险带迁移、段落级 difflib 对齐逐段 delta、七类特征清除/残留清单（与 pp_fix_suggest 同口径）、编辑幅度（字数比+段落替换率）。仅为本引擎口径下的相对参考，不构成任何机构判定。支持 `--json`、`--demo` 与 `pp_api.rewrite_check()`。
- **批量 HTML 汇总报告（`scripts/pp_batch_report.py`，或 `pp.py batch-report`）**：`--batch --csv` 产物渲染为单文件 HTML——总数/均分/风险分档卡片、分数分布直方图、按分数降序逐文件表（ERROR/unknown 置顶提示）。零依赖，不重跑引擎（只渲染既有 CSV）。
- **文档补全**：batch CSV 并发语义（v4.9.0 起原子写）与 `degraded_notice` 阅读指引显式入 FAQ。

## v5.0.0 更新内容

- **句子级改写建议（`scripts/pp_fix_suggest.py`，或 `pp.py fix`）**：分数之后的自然下一步——具体哪几句、因为什么、往哪个方向改。每个被标记的句子列出其具体特征（AI套话/填充短语/模板句式/模糊限定/连接词开头/破折号冒号习惯/均匀节律）并给出各类改写策略。只指位与策略、不代写不自动改写——改写决定权在作者本人。支持 `--json`、内置双样例演示（`--demo`），并已在 `pp_workflow` 报告中新增 `fix_suggest` 块。
- **随包单元测试套件（`tests/`，`pp.py test`）**：44 个标准库 unittest 用例，覆盖铁律（短文本/空输入/GBK）、报告字段契约、JSON 纯净性、门禁、工作流 Markdown 布局、数据文件与新工具——不装模型也能在自己机器上验证行为。
- **结构化零网络自证（`scripts/pp_verify.py`，或 `pp.py verify`）**：AST 级扫描全部脚本——网络 import/调用与 curl/wget 式子进程命令一律命中；报告页脚的 URL 字符串被正确视为数据（旧 grep 建议区分不了这两者）。exit 0=零网络调用。
- **语域感知 2.0**：文学叙事文本获得专门语域提示（该语域超出学术校准域；实测文学名篇在本引擎可达 high 档），结果请勿当作 AI 证据。仅披露，不改任何打分；全部已发布数字保持可复现。
- **打包**：`requirements.txt` 随包（核心零依赖；可选监督层依赖注释声明）；`pp.py quickstart` 零模型一键体验（detect → fix → doctor）；`pp_doctor` 新增最近留出集评测记录行；速查表补 quality_report 行。

## v4.9.0 更新内容

- **混写文档校准（收口 v4.7.0 backlog）**：段落级 hi/med/lo 阈值在可控混写基准（333 段逐段真值）上完成校准（最优工作点 ≥50 分：精度 0.60、覆盖 63%——诚实低于自动判定可用线，排序辅助）。校准口径中途修正：早先网格把中带剔出二分类导致 F1 虚高 0.85，按全带语义重算（真值 0.6131）。随包发布 `references/para_thresholds.json` 并在每次 `mixed_document` 评估中透出。
- **统一入口（`scripts/pp.py`）**：一条命令路由全部 11 个子命令——脚本导航成本清零。
- **可靠性**：批处理 CSV 改原子写（临时文件+改名，并发跑批安全）；门禁各层崩溃/超时先重试一次再兜底。

## v4.8.0 更新内容

- **测量与输出契约诚实版（第三方独立测试轮 13 项发现逐条核实，真缺陷全修，能力观察诚实披露）**：
  `run_eval.py` 缓存键纳入引擎档位（`:nosup` 后缀）——此前规则档评测会重放监督层缓存分致基础引擎数字不可复现；现已可复现且指纹+档位双绑定：纯规则老代 **0.8985** / 当打代 **0.7149**（随包语料）。
  `--profile journal --format json` 现输出**纯 JSON**（期刊口径以 `journal_precheck` 字段嵌入，双口径统计差异已内嵌解释）；每份报告透出 `risk_bands`（现行中/高风险带阈值+校准档位——监督档与规则档各自独立校准，跨档分带差异从此可解释）；`mixed_signal` 去噪（两端各 ≥25% 段占比才报混写）；单文件 >5MB 增加提示；`--batch` 目录要求写入报错信息。
- **诚实披露**：真实期刊论文（PDF 转文本）即使全档也可能评分偏高——段落归因才是可用信号；指纹归因为启发式参考（top-n 不进分），存在误归因可能。详见 FAQ。
- **文档精度**：随包语料口径澄清（抽样 1,304 vs 全量 5,251）；术语计数修正为加载 2,308 条；零网络验证命令改为 import 精确口径。

## v4.7.0 更新内容

- **混写文档专项**：构造带逐段真值的可控混写基准（54 篇合成文档，段落仅取自留出 test 半来源；`eval/build_mixed_bench.py`，结果 `eval/results/mixed_para_20261005.json`），把边界矩阵只能定性提示的局限定量化：**文档级 AUROC 0.52-0.54（平均原理性局限）vs 段落级 AUROC 0.69**——段落归因达到「人工复核定位」的 triage 质量而非自动判定。`pp_workflow.py` 新增 `mixed_document` 评估块（检测/AI 段占比估计/处置指引），混写文档在 Markdown 报告中醒目标注。
- **可发现性**：description 新增 Trigger on 路由词块；README 新增中国镜像（魔搭）链接。行为零变更。

## v4.6.0 更新内容

- **端到端工作流（`scripts/pp_workflow.py` / `pp_api.workflow()`）**：一条命令跑完全部自查——AI 率检测、段落级归因、四层门禁、术语保护、翻译腔、文体、质量报告、AIGC 标识自查——产出单一 Markdown 报告+完整 JSON。示例见 § 快速开始。
- **TL;DR 层与文档重构**：顶部新增 30 秒上手层；历史更新说明迁至 `CHANGELOG.md`；反模式集中成节；英文 FAQ 对齐中文版。
- **评测存档整理与错误可行动化**：过时评测产物移入 `eval/results/archive/`；pp_api/pp_setup 错误信息附带恢复建议。

## v4.5.0 更新内容

- **Python API（`scripts/pp_api.py`）**：引擎可直接 import。`detect_text(text)` 进程内跑完整检测（与 CLI 同一代码路径——已做同源校验），返回纯 JSON 兼容 dict；配套 `gate_text`、`term_report`、`smell_report`、`style_report`、`quality_report_file`、`attribution`、`model_fingerprint`、`doctor_summary`。零网络、零第三方依赖、非法输入抛异常不静默。程序化集成从此不必包装 subprocess。
- **一键装模（`scripts/pp_setup.py`）**：`--model <文件>` 取代多步手动放置。先按作者签发指纹注册表（`references/supervised_models.json`）校验 md5——未登记权重一律拒绝（exit 2）——再安装、推理金丝雀自检、GREEN 确认；`--check` 查看现状。模型依旧不随包、绝不联网下载（100% 本地契约不变）。

## v4.4.0 更新内容

- **头条数字在可信测量下重测——变了**：老代留出 AUROC **0.9998**（原以为 0.9022）、当打代 AUROC **0.9400**（原以为 0.6542）、人类误报@medium **2.3%**（原以为约 20%）。旧数字是测量伪象：评测分数缓存键不绑定模型（陈旧分跨版本复放）、部署模型二进制从未指纹化。两类故障自 v4.4.0 起结构性不可能：缓存键携带模型 md5（结果 JSON 带 `model_fp`）、pp_doctor 打印模型指纹供对账。
- **数据卫生审计叫停监督层再训练（负结果，数据闭环）**：原计划的 v36 再训练（7187 行旧数据+285 篇当打代新鲜样本）已部署、并一度测出近乎完美的分离度（老代 0.9994）——随即被本版新增的污染审计否决：**那 285 篇「新鲜样本」直接取自当打代评测集本身**（gen2026 评测集 64.6% 文档进入训练集、其中 154 篇属于留出半）。v36 全部数字作废；线上监督模型维持 **v35**（指纹 `2631df3d388b`，重导出已验证；污染审计显示 v35 训练数据与评测语料仅 1 篇留出集交集，其数字干净）。诚实的再训练需要新一轮采样（当前冻结）；`eval/check_leak.py` 从此把守每一次训练。
- **评测分数缓存绑定部署模型指纹**：`run_eval.py` 缓存键纳入模型 md5——换模型不再可能静默复用陈旧分（10-02 那份「位级 0.9022」的 v36 评测正是此故障；修复后 v36 的真实数字才浮出水面）。结果 JSON 携带 `model_fp`。
- **ONNX 导出自检 + 线程预算**：导出脚本在产出二进制前强制变长推理断言（transformers 4.57.6 回归会把动态轴烘焙成静态 seq=150——现在坏图在导出当场爆掉，不会流进生产）；`PP_ORT_THREADS` 限制 ONNX 线程池（默认自动）——56 vCPU 机器上不限线程会互踩（24.9 秒/篇 → 8 线程约 1 秒/篇）；`pp_doctor` 现打印模型 md5 指纹供对账。

## v4.3.0 更新内容

- **分代评测基础设施（首批数字）**：新增当打代评测集 `eval/corpora_small/eval_gen2026.jsonl`（312 篇当打代 AI×9 家族+131 篇人类留出=443 篇）；`run_eval.py --layer` 修复。**首批分代数字：老代语料 0.9022 vs 当打代 0.6542——代际退化首次量化**（此前 AUROC 混合老代样本，当打代检测力不可见）。
- **负结果×2 数据闭环**：谱 v2 混合与 L13 平滑度信号在当打代均无增益（逐位相同/方向不支持）——当打代补救唯一路径=监督层再训练（285 篇当打代样本已在手，规划中）。

## v4.2.0 更新内容

- **批处理递归**：`--batch 目录 --recursive` 遍历子目录，文件路径相对根目录呈现。
- **GitHub README**：仓库落地页现包含工具说明、快速开始、家族工具表与合规声明（skills add 发现渠道可见全貌）。
- **门禁层3 分布复核**：复活后 40 篇留出文档判定分布验证——零解析失败、无系统性偏移（数据入档）。

## v4.1.0 更新内容

- **平滑度层正式入融合（A/B 验证）**：L13 surprisal-variation 信号（各长度带 0.06 权重）纳入融合计分。留出集 A/B：**AUROC 与基线逐位相同（0.9022）、人类误报不变**——信号在当打代文本上触发时有真实影响力，评测语料零代价。
- **批处理 CSV 输出**：`--batch DIR --csv 路径` 逐文件结果落 CSV（UTF-8 BOM，Excel 友好）。
- **段落报告披露一致化**：HTML 归因报告现携带混写预警/语域提示/编码警示——与 JSON 报告一致。

## v4.0.0 更新内容

- **相关工具互引**：报告与文档在相邻环节出口处加入下一步工具提示（引用核验、深度调研、配图），并附 arXiv 幻觉引用禁投政策提醒。
- **任务词根全覆盖**：description 融入完整任务词根集（academic writing / polish / batch rewriting guidance / terminology），搜索可发现性对齐 cite-holmes 口径。
- **家族段整理**：docsor.cn 移至成员列表后；列表连续性修复（EN/ZH）。

## v3.12.0 更新内容

- **翻译腔层复活（实质性修复）**：deai_gate 层3 解析器期望 hits[] 数组，而 translation_smell --json 只输出 total_hits——schema 漂移以来该层一直静默走中性 50 兜底。已对齐 schema，翻译腔层首次真正参与融合计分。
- **诚信提示全报告覆盖**：term_check / quality_report / style_distance / translation_smell 输出现携带与 ai_detector/deai_gate 相同的学术诚信提示——"每份报告"的表述字面为真。
- **段落计数一致性**：quality_report 改用与 ai_detector 相同的空白/过短段过滤口径（尾随空行计数不一致修复）。
- 负结果入档：谱 v2 混合（新鲜代 0.15 配比）留出集逐位相同——不采纳；L13 中篇（300-800字）扩展经评估否决（人类可评样本过少、阈值下误报 2/10）。

## v3.11.0 更新内容

- **批处理检测（--batch 目录）**：一条命令打分目录内全部 .txt/.md 文件——逐文件分数+聚合统计（均分/最高/高风险文件数），确定性输出，>5MB 自动跳过。为论文级批量自查而生。
- **段落报告一致性**：HTML 归因报告头部加入与命令行报告相同的学术诚信提示。
- **负结果如实记录**：285 篇新鲜语料的跨家族 tier-2 n-gram 挖掘，守卫后只剩主题词噪声与两条已知标记——n-gram 召回扩展已到天花板（与 v3.0 重校准结论一致）。本轮指纹入册：无（质量门坚守）。

## v3.10.0 更新内容

- **指纹新鲜度第三期（当打模型覆盖）**：OpenCode Go 通道四家族新鲜采样 135 篇（kimi-k2.7 / minimax-m3 / deepseek-v4.1 / glm-5.3）；**kimi-k2.7 入册**（零误报模式，Kimi 族归因验证通过），主题词/跨家族污染候选按质量门回滚，glm-5.3 刷新无新模式。指纹库：13 家族。宁缺毋滥——每一笔入册都经归因验证。

## v3.9.0 更新内容

- **篇幅平滑度披露（L13，DivEye 思路本地化）**：新增 surprisal-variation 层——滑窗用词变化性刻画"AI 平滑、人类起伏"。留出集长文统计：独立信号 AUROC 0.8256、阈值 6 下检出 66/146、人类误报 1/14。**按"只报可复现的数字"铁律不进融合分**（单层信噪比不足）；以证据行形式出现在报告中（谱覆盖守卫 0.35 + 低覆盖证据折扣）。
- **报告层评测模式**：`python eval/run_eval.py --layer surprisal --split test`——给任何报告层一张可复现的 AUROC/检出/误报卡片（结果存 `eval/results/layer_*.json`）；正是这个框架让我们能诚实量化 L13，而不是凭信心把它融进分数。

## v3.8.0 更新内容

- **混写预警（mixed_signal）**：段落得分显著分化时如实提示"疑似人机混写、文档级分数不可单独采信"，并引导 `paragraph_report.py` 逐段归因——把能力边界矩阵中"混合文档 AUROC 0.38"的原理性局限变成引擎侧可操作指引（对齐学界混写检测方向：三分类人写/生成/润色与双向改写基准）。
- **语域提示（register_hint）**：检测到口语/叙事表达特征时提示"评分按学术语域校准、本场景仅供参考"——能力边界矩阵的引擎侧落地。
- **编码警示（encoding_warning）**：输入含大量不可解码字节（GBK/二进制）时提示结果可能失真。
- **门禁层间分歧披露**：deai_gate 在词级层与文体层方向显著矛盾（差 ≥30）时输出分歧说明（改写稿/语域混合常见）。
- **安全与行为声明节**：主动声明并可自主复核的本地运行/零上传/零凭证/无持久化承诺（平台审核趋势对齐）。
- **指纹新鲜度二轮**：qwen3.8 补齐均衡采样（35 篇）后无低误报模式过门槛——如实不入册（与 deepseek-v4 同处置）；kimi-k3 维持入册。

## v3.7.0 更新内容

- **篇章结构启发层（L12）**：新增自媒体式篇章级 AI 腔检测——八组模式（钩子/反转/口号/互动引导/排比三连/设问自答/口播收尾/情绪渲染）；≥2 组独立命中时按密度计分（8×组数+命中数，封顶 8，总封顶 30），单组命中仅记录不加分（学术零误伤），命中明细进报告。修复句层特征盲区：纯篇章结构文本此前仅得 21-32/低风险，现进入复核带；学术语料回归 AUROC 0.9022 逐位不变、零误伤。
- **FAQ 专节（评测驱动：C 维"缺少集中的常见问题解答章节"）**：10 条高频问题集中化——短文本为何不判定、医学文本为何偏高、监督层安装与确认、degraded_mode 含义、与知网/万方不可互换、层解析失败兜底、edit_extent 定位、英文支持边界、标识合规用法。
- **各脚本速查表（C 维"脚本用法说明可以更详细"）**：8 个入口的作用/关键参数/输出一表通览。
- **极端情况报错清晰化（R 维）**：style_distance 对无句边界/无正文段落场景给出具体原因与建议，替代原"文本过短"笼统提示。

## v3.6.0 更新内容

- **学术诚信护栏**：每份报告新增 `integrity_notice` 字段/提示行；新增「学术诚信」专节；定位明示——作者自查与写作质量改进、按规披露，不用于规避检测。
- **文档按平台政策加固**：英文文档（ClawHub 读取面）以质量口径措辞替换规避式表述；中文文档口径一致。

## v3.5.0 更新内容

- **降级模式披露（诚实工程）**：`ai_detector.py` 在监督层缺席/被 `PP_NO_SUP=1` 关闭/语言门控跳过时，JSON 与文本输出均带 `degraded_mode` + `degraded_notice`，并附医学语域高估警示（含留出集真实数字）。
- **铁律 2 落地**：不足 100 字的文本不再输出风险判定（`risk=unknown` + 提示）；此前只写在文档里、代码未实现——本版修复。`quality_report.py` 对短文本显示"无法判定"而非误导性的绿色。
- **`scripts/pp_doctor.py` 环境自检**：数据完整性、脚本可编译、可选依赖、模型在位与可加载、短文本/长文本/确定性探针、deai_gate 守卫，一条命令回答"能不能跑、跑的哪档"。
- **`deai_gate.py` 用法守卫与兜底闭环**：`--help`/缺失文件不再被当成文件名误跑门禁；层超时被捕获（中性 50）；翻译腔层解析失败改走中性 50 分而非 0 分（不再把垃圾输入推向 pass 带）；术语层失败不再把 Traceback 塞进 note。
- **中文 Windows 编码加固**：全部入口强制 UTF-8 输出并容错非 UTF-8（如 GBK）输入文件——zh-CN 默认控制台不再崩溃（多专家对抗测试发现）。
- 双语文档按诚实口径重建；触发词扩容（AI率/降AI/查AI率/论文AI率/降低AI率…）。
